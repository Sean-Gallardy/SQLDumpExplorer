# SQLDumpExplorer
GUI based dump viewer for SQL Server memory dumps.

## Information
This is the new home for the SQL Server Dump Explorer/Analyzer tooling, previously at SQLDumpAnalysis.com. Previously it was a web based service, however given the feedback that a stand-alone application would be nice, I've since transitioned the entire project to be application based.

## Reporting Bugs
Please use the Issues to create bugs and ideas for functionality.
