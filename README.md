# SQLDumpExplorer
GUI based dump viewer for SQL Server memory dumps.

## Information
This is the new home for the SQL Server Dump Explorer/Analyzer tooling, previously at SQLDumpAnalysis.com. Previously it was a web based service, however given the feedback that a stand-alone application would be nice, I've since transitioned the entire project to be application based, which is currently not open source.

## Reporting Bugs
Please use the Issues to create bugs and ideas for functionality.

## Known Limitations
- Will not work on Linux or ARM dumps
- Compressed memory dumps will need to be uncompressed first
- Will only work for SQL Server, not Agent or other processes
